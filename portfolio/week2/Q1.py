#Q)1)Last week you wrote a program that printed out a cheery greeting including your name. Take a copy of it, and modify it so that the user enters their name at the keyboard, and then receives a greeting. For example:
#Hello, what is your name? Mr Apricot
#Hello, Mr Apricot. Good to meet you!

# Prompt the user to enter their name
user_input_name = input("Hey there! What's your name? ")

# Print a personalized greeting
print(f"Hello, {user_input_name}. Nice to meet you!")
